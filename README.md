# Omni Engine (ΞRuntime)

**Omni Engine** is a symbolic computational runtime built from foundational axioms and constants.  
This repository contains the **public runtime layer**, excluding proprietary constants and rule logic.

### 🔹 What It Is
- A symbolic interpreter designed to simulate emergence, recursion, curvature, and field logic.
- Driven by internal axioms such as **Presence**, **Silence**, **Curvature**, and **Echo**.
- Part of a larger symbolic OS and post-quantum geometry framework.

### 🔹 Included
- `XiRuntime.lua` – Core runtime structure
- `.gitignore` – Protects private symbolic constants

### 🔒 Not Included
- Internal constant definitions (Ξ, Φ, Θ₉, etc.)
- Rule logic engine and interpreter
- Symbolic memory and observer modules

### 🌐 Status
This repo is part of an ongoing private project to define a symbolic, axiomatic logic runtime for simulation, interaction, and truth compression.
